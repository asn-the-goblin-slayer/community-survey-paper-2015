\section{Challenges Facing Obfuscation Tools}
\label{section:challenges}
     
\subsection{Understanding Adversarial Capabilities}

Uncertainty about and disagreement over adversarial capabilities
and goals. 

\paragraph{False positives and false negatives.} 


\paragraph{Measuring ``normal'' background traffic.}


\paragraph{Known possible detection approaches.} 
\tcrnote{The academic literature has a lot of stuff on detecting obfuscated
traffic. Unsure if any has been deployed by censors. Examples:
Include perhaps parrot paper, cover
your ack paper, routing around decoy paper, active probing perhaps}
