\section{Background on Proxying Systems}
\label{section:proxying}

\subsection{Overview of typical circumventionproxy system architectures}

\subsection{Challenges faced by circumventionproxy systems}

\subsubsection{Client integrity (ensuring secure distribution of client software)}
\subsubsection{Proxy integrity (ensuring enough honest proxies)}
\subsubsection{Secure rendezvous (finding proxy IPs without making IP
blacklisting easy + key negotiation)}
\subsubsection{Network obfuscation (ensuring tool canâ€™t be recognized on wire
w/o IP blacklist) + clarification that investigating this will be the primary
focus of the paper.}


(Discuss narrowing of scope at this point to mostly focus on network obfuscation)
